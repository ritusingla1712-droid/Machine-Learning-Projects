# Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains end-to-end Data Analysis and Machine Learning projects
implemented using Python, SQL, and Tableau. The projects focus on working with
structured datasets to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
correlation analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

These projects demonstrate practical understanding of the complete data workflow,
from raw data to insights, using industry-relevant tools and clear documentation.

## What This Repository Covers
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation and trend analysis
- Data visualization using Tableau
- Supervised Machine Learning models
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Tableau

## Types of Projects Included
- Correlation analysis (e.g., rainfall vs crop yield)
- Classification and regression models
- Customer and sales data analysis
- SQL-based data exploration and insights

## Purpose
This repository showcases my applied skills in Data Analysis and Machine Learning
and is intended for Data Analyst and Junior Data Scientist job roles.
